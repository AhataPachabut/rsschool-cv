### Reason for applying for a job 
I have a higher technical education and worked for 4 years as a developer of 1C. I have finished java courses, have a certificate. I improve my English level. And now I apply for the position of a java developer.
I have experience in communicating with clients, making technical documentation, can quickly orientate in various subject areas, easily learn new things and want to expand my knowledge. I think that my experience will be useful.
